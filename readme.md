Your Shiny Application
========================

1.	Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2.	Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3.	Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4.	Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

The application must include the following:

1.	Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2.	Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3.	Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4.	You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5.	The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.


Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation
=====================================

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need

1.	5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
2.	Your presentation pushed to github
3.	A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below

Your presentation must satisfy the following:

1.	It must be done in Slidify
2.	It must be 5 pages
3.	It must be on github
4.	It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github, there's the publish command: publish(user = "USER", repo = "REPO", host = 'github')
